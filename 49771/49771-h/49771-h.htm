<div class="blockquott">
<p><i>The author ventures to suggest to the readers of this play that he
makes no pretensions to throw a new light on any of the questions which
are discussed in it, nor has he attempted to offer a solution of
problems which, judging from the diversity of opinion which they have
occasioned, may be regarded as insoluble. He has tried to put into
dramatic form some of the thoughts and emotions which have recently
agitated many, and for this purpose he has chosen the most ordinary
characters in the circle with which, owing to his own circumstances, he
is best acquainted. But because it is a good many years since he was on
terms of intimate familiarity with a parish priest, and he was not
certain how much the views of the clergy had changed, the author has put
into the mouth of the Rev. Norman Poole phrases from Dr. Gore’s “The
Religion of the Church,” and from a sermon by Dr. Stewart Holden. Since
it is impossible in a play to indicate by quotation marks what is
borrowed, the author takes this opportunity to acknowledge his
indebtedness for the Rev. Norman Poole’s most characteristic speeches.</i></p>

<div class="blockquott">
<p class="hang"><i>The drawing-room at the Manor House</i>, <span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton’s</span>
<i>residence. It is a simple room, somewhat heavily furnished in an
old-fashioned style; there is nothing in it which is in the least
artistic; but the furniture is comfortable, and neither new nor
shabby. On the papered walls are the Academy pictures of forty
years ago. There are a great many framed photographs of men in
uniform, and here and there a bunch of simple flowers in a vase.
The only things in the room which are at all exotic are silver
ornaments from Indian bazaars and flimsy Indian fabrics, used as
cloths on the occasional tables and as drapery on the piano.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><i>At the back are French windows leading into the garden; and this,
with its lawn and trees, is seen through them. It is summer, and
the windows are open. Morning.</i></p>

<p><a name="page_002" id="page_002"></a></p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton</span> <i>is sitting in the corner of the sofa, knitting a
khaki comforter. She is a slight, tall woman of five-and-fifty; she
has deliberate features, with kind eyes and a gentle look; her dark
hair is getting very gray; it is simply done; and her dress, too,
is simple; it is not at all new and was never fashionable.</i></p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Kate</span>, <i>a middle-aged maid-servant, in a print dress, a cap and
apron, comes in</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Kate.</span></p>

<p>If you please, ma’am, the butcher’s called.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Oh! I arranged with Cook that we should have cold roast beef again for
luncheon to-day, Kate. Tell the butcher to bring two and a half pounds
of the best end of the neck for to-night, and tell him to pick me out a
really nice piece, Kate. It’s so long since the Major has had any good
English meat.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Kate.</span></p>

<p>Very good, ma’am.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>And he might send in a couple of kidneys. The Colonel and Major Wharton
enjoyed the kidneys that they had for breakfast yesterday so much.<a name="page_003" id="page_003"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Kate.</span></p>

<p>Very good, ma’am. If you please, ma’am, the gardener hasn’t sent in a
very big basket of pease. Cook says it won’t look much for three.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Oh, well, it doesn’t matter as long as there are enough for the
gentlemen. I’ll just pretend to take some.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Kate.</span></p>

<p>Very good, ma’am.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="rt"><i>As she is going</i>, <span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton</span> <i>enters from the garden with a
basket of cherries. He is a thin old man, much older than his wife,
with white hair; but though very frail he still carries himself
erectly. His face is bronzed by long exposure to tropical suns, but
even so it is the face of a sick man. He wears a light tweed suit
which hangs about him loosely, as though he had shrunk since it was
made for him. He has a round tweed hat of the same material.</i></p>
</div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Has the paper come yet, Kate?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Kate.</span></p>

<p>Yes, sir. I’ll bring it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Kate</span></p></div>

<p><a name="page_004" id="page_004"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I’ve brought you in some cherries, Evelyn. They’re the only ripe ones I
could find.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Oh, that is nice. I hope you’re not tired.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Great Scott, I’m not such a crock that it can tire me to pick a few
cherries. If I’d been able to find a ladder I’d have got you double the
number.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Oh, my dear, you’d better let the gardener get them. I don’t approve of
your skipping up and down ladders.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>The gardener’s just as old as I am and not nearly so active. Hasn’t John
come in yet? He said he was only going to the post.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps he went in to see Sylvia on the way back.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I shouldn’t have thought she wanted to be bothered with him in the
morning.<a name="page_005" id="page_005"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>George!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Yes, dear.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>It seems so extraordinary to hear you say: “Hasn’t John come in yet? He
said he was only going to the post.” It makes me rather want to cry.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>It’s been a long time, Evelyn. It’s been a bad time for both of us, my
dear. But worse for you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I tried not to be troublesome, George.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Dear child, aren’t I there to share your troubles with you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>It seems so natural that he should come in any minute, it seems as
though he’d never been away&mdash;and yet somehow I can’t quite believe it.
It seems incredible that he should really be back.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Patting her hand.</i>] My dear Evelyn!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Kate</span> <i>brings in the paper and gives it to the</i> <span class="smcap">Colonel</span>. <i>She goes

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Thank you. [<i>While he puts on his spectacles.</i>] It’s a blessing to be
able to read the births, deaths, and marriages like a gentleman instead
of turning before anything else to the casualties.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I hope before long that we shall be composing a little announcement for
that column.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Have they settled a day yet, those young people?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know. John hasn’t said anything, and I didn’t see Sylvia
yesterday except for a moment after church.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Evelyn dear, the gardener tells me he hasn’t got much in the way of
pease ready for to-night, so I’ve told him to send in a few carrots for
me; I think they’re probably better for my digestion.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Nonsense, George. You know how much you like pease, and I’m not very
fond of them. I was hoping there’d only be enough for two so that I
shouldn’t have to eat any.<a name="page_007" id="page_007"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Evelyn, where do you expect to go when you die if you tell such stories?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Now, George, don’t be obstinate. You might give in to me sometimes.
They’re the first pease out of the garden and I should like you to eat
them.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>No, my dear, I’d like to see you eat them. I’m an invalid, and I must
have my own way.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>You tyrant! You haven’t seen Dr. Macfarlane this morning? I’m so
anxious.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>You old fusser! No sooner have you stopped worrying over your boy than
you start worrying over me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Even though you won’t let me call my soul my own, I don’t want to lose
you just yet.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Don’t be alarmed. I shall live to plague you for another twenty years.</p>

<p>If you please, ma’am, Mrs. Poole has called.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Why haven’t you shown her in?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Kate.</span></p>

<p>She wouldn’t come in, ma’am. She said she was passing and she just
stopped to enquire how you were.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Tell her to come in, Kate. What’s she making all this fuss about.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Kate.</span></p>

fellow himself.</p>

<p>What do you mean by trying to get away without showing yourself? Is this

<p>[<i>Shaking hands with</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton</span> <i>and with the</i> <span class="smcap">Colonel</span>.] I wanted to
come in, but I thought you mightn’t wish to see me to-day, so I put it
like that to make it easier for you to send me about my business.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>We always wish to see you, my dear.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>If I had a son that I hadn’t seen for four years and he’d been
dangerously wounded, I think I’d want to keep him to myself for the
first few days after he got home.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Then you’re not as unselfish a woman as Evelyn.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Or perhaps not nearly so vain.<a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>Did you go down to the station to meet him on Saturday?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>The Colonel went. He wouldn’t let me go because he said I’d make a fool
of myself on the platform.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I took Sylvia. I thought that was enough. I knew I could trust her to
control herself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>And when are they going to be married.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I hope very soon. It’s been a long and anxious time for her.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>Can you bear to give him up when he’s only just come back to you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Oh, but it’s not giving him up when he’s marrying Sylvia. She’s been
like a daughter to us. D’you know, they’ve been engaged for seven
years.<a name="page_011" id="page_011"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>I hope they’ll be very happy. Sylvia certainly deserves to be.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>She’s done cheerfully the most difficult thing anyone can do. All
through the war when she was pining to be off and do her bit she stayed
at home with a bed-ridden mother.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Bullough.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Yes, but poor Sylvia too. It’s easy enough to do your duty when duty is
dangerous and exciting, but when you can do nothing&mdash;no one knows better
than I what it is to sit still and look on when others are doing the
things that are worth while. This war came ten years too late for me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>That’s what the Vicar has been saying ever since the war began. But
after all your son has taken your place, and I think you can be proud of
him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With intense satisfaction.</i>] The rascal with his Military Cross and
his D.S.O.<a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>I’m so glad that his first day here was a Sunday.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>You don’t know what I felt when we knelt down side by side in church. I
was very grateful.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>I know. I could see it in your face and the Colonel’s.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>God has vouchsafed us a great mercy.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I think we were a little disappointed, too. We were so surprised when
John walked out.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>Did he say why he had?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>No. I talked it over with the Colonel. We didn’t quite know what to do.
I don’t know whether to mention it or not.<a name="page_013" id="page_013"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>I do hope he’ll stay next Sunday.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>He was always a very regular communicant.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I don’t see why you shouldn’t say something to him about it, Evelyn.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>You ungrateful fellow! When have I hesitated to carry out your slightest

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>He’s only been back forty-eight hours, poor dear.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Didn’t I go down to you on my bended knees in the middle of the road and
ask you to come for a walk with me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Oh, well, I wanted to see your father. I was anxious to hear what the
specialist had said.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Surprised.</i>] Have you been seeing a specialist, father? Aren’t you
well?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Perfectly. It was only to satisfy your poor mother.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>But why didn’t you tell me? Is anything the matter with him, mother?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>My dear, your father wouldn’t let me tell you anything about it when you
came. He didn’t want you to be worried. And I thought myself it might
just as well keep till to-day.<a name="page_017" id="page_017"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>The fact is I haven’t been quite up to the mark lately, and Dr.
Macfarlane thought I’d better see a specialist. So I went into
Canterbury on Saturday and saw Dr. Keller.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I heard you’d been to see him. They say he’s very clever.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>What did he say?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Well, you know what these doctor fellows are. He wouldn’t say much to
me. He said he’d write to Macfarlane.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I suppose Macfarlane got the letter this morning. He’ll probably be
round presently.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>I saw him going along the Bleane Road in his dog-cart about an hour ago.
You might ask him who it was he was going to see.<a name="page_018" id="page_018"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Are you feeling ill, father?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>No. I shouldn’t have dreamed of going to a specialist, only your mother
was worrying.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Don’t put all the blame on her. I was, too.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Going over to him and putting his arm in his.</i>] Poor old father, you

<p>Oh, I’m not going to die just yet, you know.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>I’ve long given up the attempt.</p>

<p>I thought I’d look in and say how-do-you-do to the wounded hero.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>My son. The Vicar.<a name="page_020" id="page_020"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>Welcome! I passed you in the village just now. I had half a mind to come
up and wring your hand, but I thought you’d say, who the deuce is this
clerical gent?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>How do you do?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>An authentic hero. And he speaks just like you and me. The world’s a
strange place, my masters. Well, what d’you think of Blighty?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I’m very glad to be home again. I thought I never should get back.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>You’ve not been home since the beginning of the war, have you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>No, you see I was in India when it broke out. What with Gallipoli and
one thing and another, I was done out of my leave every time.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>Well, it’s a long lane that has no turning. But I understand that you’ve
picked up some bits and pieces here and there. The Military Cross and
the D.S.O., isn’t it?<a name="page_021" id="page_021"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>You must be a very proud man.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>How did you win them?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I don’t know. Playing about generally.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I don’t think you’ll get very much more than that out of John.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">John</span>.] You lucky beggar! You’ve had your chance and you were able
to take it. That’s where I should have been, where my heart was, with
the brave lads at the front. And my confounded chest has kept me chained
to this little tin-pot parish.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>My husband suffers from his lungs.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I’m sorry to hear that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>Yes, the Great White Peril. They say its ravages are terrible. That’s
why I came here, you know; I was in charge of the parish of St. Jude’s,
Stoke<a name="page_022" id="page_022"></a> Newington when I crocked up. I tried to get them to let me go
when the war broke out, but they wouldn’t hear of it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>They also serve who only stand and wait.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>I know, I know. It’s this confounded energy of mine. I’m a crock, and
I’ve just had to make the best of it. I’m on the shelf. The future is in
the hands of you brave lads who’ve been through the fire. I suppose you
went to sleep during my sermon yesterday.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Not at all. I listened to it very attentively.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>I shouldn’t blame you if you had. That’s about all I’ve been able to do
during the war, to preach. And, upon my word, I sometimes wonder what
good I’ve done.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>You’ve been a great help to us all.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>For my part I don’t deplore the war. Our Lord said: “Think not that I
come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.” The
Christian Church has lived by her sword. Every advance<a name="page_023" id="page_023"></a> which this world
of ours has known in liberty, in justice, in enlightenment, has been won
for it by the sword of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I wish all parsons were as broad-minded. I know what war is. I was in
Egypt and in South Africa. I’ve been through half a dozen wars in India.
I have no use for slop and sentimentality. My own belief is that war is
necessary to a nation. It brings out all a man’s best qualities.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>There I heartily agree with you. It is the great school of character.
Amid the clash of arms the great Christian virtues shine forth with an
immortal lustre. Courage, self-sacrifice, charity, self-reliance. No one
knew before the war what a pinnacle of heroism was within the power of
our brave lads at the front.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>What do you think about it, Major Wharton?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] I? I think it’s a lovely day. I have three weeks leave, and
the war is a long way off.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a chuckle.</i>] A very good answer. I’ve been saying the obvious, I
know that just as well as you<a name="page_024" id="page_024"></a> do, but, you know, sometimes the obvious
has to be said, and when it has, I think a man should have the courage
to say it. Now, my dear, let’s be off.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know what Mrs. Wharton will think of us for inflicting ourselves
on her like this.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>We’re all friends here, I hope and trust. If we weren’t welcome, Mrs.
Wharton only had to say so. To my mind the afternoon call is a
convention more honoured in the breach than the observance.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>It’s been very good of you to come.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>There is a general shaking of hands.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">John</span>.] Well, good-bye, young fellow. I’ve tried to show you that
I’m by way of being rather broad-minded as parsons go. It wouldn’t shock
me in the least to hear you say “damn” or “blast.” I’m often inclined to
use a bit of strong language myself. I asked you just now if you’d gone
to sleep during my sermon. I wouldn’t have turned a hair if you had.<a name="page_025" id="page_025"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>It’s very kind of you to say so. I may avail myself of your suggestion
on some future occasion.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>On a future occasion, perhaps&mdash;shall we say next Sunday?&mdash;I hope you
won’t leave the House of God without partaking in the greatest of all
the Sacraments of our Church. Don’t forget that the Almighty has in His
mercy brought you in safety through great and terrible peril. That’s all
I wanted to say to you. Good-bye, God bless you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Good-bye.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Shaking hands with</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton</span>] Good-bye. These parsons, what a
nuisance they make of themselves, don’t they?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I wanted to ask you if you’d seen poor Mrs. Littlewood since her return.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>No, she didn’t come to church yesterday. And of course, Sunday’s my busy
day&mdash;I’m the only man in the parish who works seven days a week&mdash;so I
haven’t had a chance to see her yet, poor soul.<a name="page_026" id="page_026"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>She came down by the 6.35 on Saturday. She was in the same train as
John, but I wasn’t bothering much about anyone else just then, and I
didn’t speak to her.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I wish we could do something for her.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Explaining to</i> <span class="smcap">John</span>.] She was telegraphed for last week to go to Ned
at Boulogne. He died on Tuesday.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With astonishment.</i>] Ned! But he was only a kid.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Oh, he’d grown up since you were home. He was nearly nineteen.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>Both her sons are gone now. She’s quite alone.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>We must all be very kind to her. It will be terrible for her in that big
house all by herself. I wish you’d spoken to her on Saturday, George.<a name="page_027" id="page_027"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I felt rather shy about it. After all, we’ve had rather an anxious time
over that young scamp there. If anything had happened to him&mdash;well, I
should have had Evelyn, but she, poor soul, has nobody.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>I ought to have gone to see her yesterday.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>She must be absolutely prostrated with grief.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>I wonder if she’d like to come and stay at the Vicarage. I can’t bear to
think of her all alone.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>That’s a splendid idea, Norman, and just like you. I’ll ask her at once.
I’ll be glad to do what I can for her.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Of course one ought to try and find something to occupy her mind.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>Happily she has always been a deeply religious woman. When all’s said

<p>No. I picked up a very nice woman in the hotel, and we went out
together. We went to the Gaiety one night and the next we went to the
Empire. Do you know that I’d never seen George Robey before?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Mrs. Littlewood, I’m sure you don’t want to give parties just now.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Littlewood.</span></p>

<p>I’d love to. It’s so seldom one gets an excuse for one in a place like
this.</p>

<p>Isn’t she going to, do you suppose?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I can’t understand it. She adored those boys.</p>

must be as hard as nails.</p>

<p>No, she isn’t that. I’ve known her for thirty-five years. D’you think
she’s mad?<a name="page_034" id="page_034"></a></p>

<p>Before you go let’s tell them what we’ve been talking about.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I don’t think it’s very hard to guess.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I want Sylvia to marry me as soon as ever it’s possible.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>If we look nippy we can get a special licence and be married on
Thursday. We don’t want to go far for our honeymoon, because I have such
a short time. And my suggestion is London.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>What do you think, Mrs. Wharton?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Well, my dear, I think that whatever you and John decide will be quite
right.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>He’s only just come back to you. I can’t bear to take him away
immediately. Wouldn’t you prefer us to wait a little longer?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>My dear, we’ve always decided that you should be married the moment he
came back. We’ve been quite prepared to lose him. And perhaps after a
few days, if the Colonel’s well enough, you wouldn’t mind if we came up
to London, too. We’d try not to be in your way.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Going down on her knees beside</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton</span> <i>and kissing her</i>.] Oh,

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>It’s been a weary, anxious time for all of us. I know how unhappy you’ve
been sometimes. I want you to have him now. He’s a good boy, and I think
he’ll make you happy.</p>

<p>I expect you’ll be quite good enough for the likes of me. Then it’s to

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Did you like the Vicar, John?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>He seemed all right.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>He’s a first-rate fellow. He had a very good living in London at one
time, and he resigned and took one in the East End instead.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Really?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>He said he wasn’t ordained to drink China tea with elderly women of
means. [<i>With a chuckle.</i>] He says very good things sometimes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>They were perfectly wonderful in the East End. They wanted to live in
exactly the same way as their parishioners, so they did without a
servant, and did all their housework, even their washing, themselves.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>It sounds hateful, but of course it really was heroic.<a name="page_039" id="page_039"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>D’you remember what he said to you about Holy Communion? Your father and
I were a little disappointed that you didn’t stay for it yesterday.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I’m sorry for that, mother dear.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>It would have been such a great pleasure to both of us if we could all
three have received it together.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Dear mother.... If you’re really going home to luncheon, Sylvia, I’ll
walk back with you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>The Vicar has a Communion service on Wednesday morning. Would you come
then? It’ll be the last opportunity before your marriage.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Oh, my dear, you’re not going to ask me to get up in the middle of the
night? After all, one of the pleasures of coming home is to lie in bed
in the morning. I don’t know how I ever tear myself out of those
lavender-scented sheets.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Dear John, won’t you come to please us?<a name="page_040" id="page_040"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Still trying to pass it off lightly.</i>] Oh, my dear mother, d’you think
it’s really necessary?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I should like it so much, my dear. You know, it means a great deal to
us.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>More gravely.</i>] Don’t you think one should go to a ceremony like that
in a certain frame of mind?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Good-humouredly.</i>] Come, my boy, you’re not going to refuse the first
request your mother has made you since you came back?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I’m awfully sorry, mother. I beg you not to insist.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I don’t quite know what you mean. It’s not like you to be obstinate....
Won’t you come, John?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>No, mother.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Why not?<a name="page_041" id="page_041"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I’ve been away a long time. There are some things one can’t help, you
know. I’ve been through very terrible experiences.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Aghast.</i>] Do you mean to say you’ve lost your&mdash;faith?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I’m awfully sorry to give you pain, dear.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Her eyes fixed on him.</i>] You’ve not answered your mother’s question,
John.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>If you want a direct answer, I’m afraid it must be&mdash;yes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Overcome.</i>] Oh, John!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>But you came to church yesterday.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>That was just a formal ceremony. I assisted passively, as a Jew might
assist at the wedding of one of his Christian friends.<a name="page_042" id="page_042"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>You stood when we stood, and knelt down, and seemed to pray.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I would do that if I were in a Roman Catholic church. That seemed to me
only good manners. [<i>With a smile.</i>] Do you think it was very deceitful?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>I don’t quite see why you should strain at a gnat.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I don’t. It’s the camel I can’t swallow. I knew it would distress you if
I refused to come to church. I didn’t want to seem a prig. But the other
seems to me different. When I’m asked to take an active part in a
ceremony that means nothing to me it’s quite another matter. I’d rather
not tell a deliberate lie. And surely from your point of view it would
be blasphemous.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Occupied with her own thoughts.</i>] How dreadful!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Going up to her and putting his arm round her.</i>] Don’t be unhappy,
mother. I can’t help feeling as I do. After all, these are matters that
only concern oneself.<a name="page_043" id="page_043"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Reflecting.</i>] Are they?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Surely. [<i>To his mother.</i>] I would rather not have told you. I knew how
much you’d take it to heart. But I was obliged to. And perhaps it’s
better as it is. I hated the thought of deceiving you and father. Now
let’s put it out of our minds.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>John, have you forgotten, that in three weeks you’ll be going back to
the Front? Sooner or later you’ll find yourself once more in the
fighting line. Have you asked yourself what it will be like to face
death without the help of Almighty God?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>It’s always difficult to face death.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>You wouldn’t be the first who found it easy to stand alone when all was
going well and found it a very different thing in danger or illness.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a smile.</i>] When the devil was sick, the devil a monk would be.<a name="page_044" id="page_044"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Archie, Mrs. Littlewood’s elder boy, was badly wounded on the Somme. His
battalion had to retreat and somehow or other he wasn’t picked up. He
lay in the corner of a wood for three days and kept himself alive on a
beet that he pulled out of the field. Heaven knows, I don’t want
anything like that to happen to you, but are you sure your courage
wouldn’t fail you then? Are you sure you wouldn’t call on God
instinctively to help you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>And if I did, what of it? That wouldn’t be me, that mangled, bleeding,
starved, delirious thing. It’s me now that speaks, now that I’m well and
conscious and strong. It’s the real me now. I disclaim and disown
anything I may feel or say when I’m tortured with pain and sickness. It
would give my real self just as little as a prisoner on the rack gives
the truth.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking at him fixedly.</i>] You’re afraid of something like that
happening, aren’t you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I shouldn’t like my body to play me a dirty trick when I hadn’t the
presence of mind to look after it.<a name="page_045" id="page_045"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Have you ever been in real danger since you&mdash;since you began to think
like this?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Yes. Once I was in a trench the Germans had enfiladed. They’d got the
line exactly. The shells fell one after another, first at the end of the
trench, and then they came slowly down. One could calculate almost
mathematically when the shell must come that would blow one to
smithereens.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a little gasp of terror.</i>] Oh, John, don’t!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Well, something went wrong, or else I certainly shouldn’t
be here now.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Do you mean to say you weren’t frightened?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Frightened isn’t the word for it. Talk of getting the wind up: it was a
perfect hurricane. I felt as though I were shrinking up so that my
clothes suddenly hung about me like sacks. And against my will a prayer
came to my lips. From long habit, I suppose, they tried to form
themselves into an<a name="page_046" id="page_046"></a> appeal to God to turn the shell away. I had to fight
with myself. I had to keep saying to myself: “Don’t be a fool. Don’t be
a damned fool.”</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>And you resisted? It was the voice of God speaking to you. The prayer
was said in your heart, and He in His mercy heard it. Doesn’t that prove
to you that you’re wrong? At that moment you believed, even though you
struggled not to. Your whole soul cried out its belief in God.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>No, not my soul: my fear of death.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I’ve been in battle, too. In South Africa and in the Soudan we were in
some pretty tight places now and then. When I went into action I
commended my soul to God, and now that I’m an old man I can say that I
never knew fear.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I don’t think I’m particularly brave. Before an attack I’ve often had to
light a cigarette to hide the trembling of my lips.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>The Christian doesn’t fear death. His whole life is but a preparation
for that awful moment. To him it is the shining gateway to life
everlasting.<a name="page_047" id="page_047"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I should be sorry to think that life was nothing but a preparation for
death. To my mind death is very unimportant. I think a man does best to
put it out of his thoughts. He should live as though life were endless.
Life is the thing that matters.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Doesn’t that suggest a very base materialism?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>No, because you can’t make the most of life unless you’re willing to
risk it, and it’s the risk that makes the difference. It’s the most
precious thing a man has, but it’s valueless unless he’s prepared to
stake it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>What do you think it can be worth while to risk life for?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Almost anything. Honour or love. A song, a thought. [<i>After a moment’s
reflection, with a smile.</i>] A five-barred gate.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Isn’t that rather illogical?<a name="page_048" id="page_048"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps. I don’t put it very well. I think what I mean is that life in
itself has no value. It’s what you put in it that gives it worth.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Why do you think you’ve come safely through the perils and dangers of
the war? John, do you know that every day your mother and Sylvia and I
prayed that God might see fit to spare you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With sudden energy.</i>] Were you the only ones? Why didn’t He see fit to
spare the others?</p>

<p>[<i>Answering his son.</i>] I don’t know what you mean by that. In war
somebody’s got to be killed. When a commander gives battle he knows

<p>If you don’t mind my saying so, I think we’d much better not start

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

pious boy.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Oh, mother, that’s rather a terrible thing to say to
anybody.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With an answering smile.</i>] Oh, I didn’t mean it like that. On the
contrary, you were rather troublesome. Sometimes you were very
headstrong and obstinate.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>That’s better.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>We tried to bring you up to fear God. It used to make me happy sometimes
to see how simple and touching your faith was. You used to pray to God
for all sorts of absurd things, to make a lot of runs in a cricket match
or to pass an exam, that you hadn’t worked for.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I remember.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>If you’ve lost your faith, we know it can’t be as so many lose it, on
purpose, because they’ve<a name="page_050" id="page_050"></a> given themselves over to sensuality, and dare
not believe in a God whom every action of their lives insults. If you’ll
only tell us everything, perhaps we can help you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>My dear, you’d much better let the matter rest. I should only have to
say things that would hurt you all.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>We’re willing to take the risk of that. We know you wouldn’t hurt us
intentionally. Perhaps they’re only difficulties that we might be able
to explain. And if we’re not clever enough perhaps the Vicar can.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dr. Macfarlane.</span></p>

<p>You military gentlemen, you want to go so fast.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dr. Macfarlane.</span></p>

<p>It’s very technical. Saving your presence, I don’t think any of you
would make head or tail of it. Now, Mrs. Wharton, my dear, shall you and
I go for a little stroll in your beautiful garden, and we’ll have a talk
about this old tyrant.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>What’s the object of that? Evelyn will only tell me everything you’ve

me in her life.</p>

<p>Well, <i>I’m</i> no chicken, and I’m not going to stand any of your nonsense.

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>What is this you’re up to? What in heaven’s name are you making a baby’s

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Pretending to be a little shocked.</i>] Don’t be naughty, John. It’s for
poor Annie Black’s baby.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Who’s she?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>She was engaged to Edward Driffield, the carpenter’s second man, and
they were going to be married next time he came home on leave. He’s been
killed, and she’s expecting a baby.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Poor thing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>The Pooles are looking after her. You see, she had nowhere to go, and
they didn’t want her to have to go to the Workhouse, so Mrs. Poole has
taken her in at the Vicarage. And I said I’d make all the baby’s things.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Affectionately.</i>] You’re a nice old mother.<a name="page_064" id="page_064"></a></p>

<p>Yes, charming.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>They’re coming here this afternoon, John. I wanted the Vicar to see your
father.... I haven’t told your father they’re coming.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Haven’t you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>He’s rather sensitive just now. It’s quite natural, isn’t it? And I
didn’t know exactly how he’d take it. I thought if Mrs. Poole came too
it would look as though it were just a friendly visit. And perhaps the
Vicar will have an opportunity to say a few words to your father.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] I take it that you want me to help you to leave them alone
together.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I hate doing anything underhand, John, but I think it would help your
father so much if he could have a little private talk with the Vicar.<a name="page_065" id="page_065"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Why didn’t you suggest it to him?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I didn’t like to. I was afraid he’d be vexed. I thought he’d suggest it
himself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Very tenderly.</i>] Don’t distress yourself, mother.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I’m trying not to think of it, John. My only hope is that the end may
come without suffering.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I wasn’t thinking of that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>[<i>After a moment’s pause.</i>] I don’t know what you mean, John.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Yes, you do. You only have to look in father’s face.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I really don’t understand. [<i>Almost vehemently.</i>] You’re wrong, John. He
suffers much more pain than you think. That’s what gives him that look.<a name="page_066" id="page_066"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Gravely.</i>] It’s fear that’s in his face, mother, the fear of death.
You know it just as well as I do.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With dismay.</i>] I was so hoping that no one would know but me. It tears
my heart. And I can do nothing. And he’s so strange. Sometimes he looks
at me almost as though I were his enemy.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>He doesn’t want to die, does he? At the bottom of his heart is envy
because you can go on living.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Have you noticed that? I tried not to see it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Don’t be angry with him or disappointed. You know, it’s a hard thing to
die for all of us. Generally one’s vitality is lowered so that life
seems rather a burden, and it’s not very hard then to make a seemly end.
But poor father’s got something much more difficult to face.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>He’s been supported all his life by his confidence in the great truths
of our religion. Oh, John, it’s<a name="page_067" id="page_067"></a> so dreadful that just at this moment,
when he must put them all to the test, he should falter. It’s almost a
betrayal of the God who loves him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>My dear, you can’t imagine that God won’t understand? What do these last
weeks matter beside a life that has been cheerful and innocent, devout,
unselfish, and dutiful? We were talking about it the other day, don’t
you remember? And I claimed that a man should be judged by what he
believed and did in the heyday of his strength, and not by what was
wrung from him in a moment of anguish. Pray that God may give my father
courage and resignation.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>How can you ask me to pray, John, when you don’t believe in God?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Pray all the same, my dear, and for me too.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I don’t suppose I shall survive your father very long, dear. Husbands
and wives who’ve been so much to one another as we have don’t often make
a very good job of separation. I’m so glad to think that you’ll have
Sylvia.<a name="page_068" id="page_068"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Sylvia’s a good girl, isn’t she?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>When you were away I was dreadfully anxious on my own account, of
course, but I was anxious on hers too. She’s had a very hard time with
her mother, and there’s been dreadfully little money, only their
pensions; if anything had happened to you, when her mother died she
would have had practically nothing. You’ve been engaged so long and
she’s not very young any more. It’s not likely that anyone else would
have wanted to marry her.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Mother darling, you’re being terribly sentimental now.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With comic indignation.</i>] I’m not, John. You don’t know what it is for
a penniless woman to be quite alone in the world when she’s lost her
youth.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I do. But the tears needn’t come into your eyes, because Sylvia and
I are going to be married and her future is quite adequately provided
for.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>She’s the only girl I’ve ever known that I could bear to think of your
marrying.<a name="page_069" id="page_069"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Well, as she’s the only girl I ever knew that I could bear to marry,
we’re both quite satisfied.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know why Evelyn should think I want to be molly-coddled out of

face it like a gentleman and a soldier.</p>

<p>I was rather hurt. I’m not aware that there’s been anything in my

discourtesy. Our relations have always been more than cordial.</p>

had various things to say to you which I thought you should hear, so
yesterday I called again, and again was told you were out.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Littlewood.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Coolly.</i>] I didn’t wish to see you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>May I ask why?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Littlewood.</span></p>

<p>Well, I suppose you wanted to talk about my boy. I didn’t think your
conversation could give him back to me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>Don’t you think I could have helped you to bear your loss? I think I
could have found in my heart words to persuade you to resignation. I
might at least have offered you my sympathy.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Littlewood.</span></p>

<p>I’m sorry to seem ungracious, but I don’t want your sympathy.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>Your attitude amazes me.<a name="page_083" id="page_083"></a></p>

<p>[<i>Reflectively.</i>] No, I’m not exactly indifferent.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>Since you won’t see me alone, I must say things to you here and now
which I should rather have kept for your private ear. I have a right to
remonstrate with you because your behaviour is a scandal to my parish.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Littlewood.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a smile.</i>] Oh, I beg your pardon. I thought it was my welfare you

like.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Flushing, but not to be put off.</i>] I think it was horrible to go to a
music-hall on the very day you had returned from your son’s grave in
France. But that was in London, and you outraged nobody but yourself.
What you do here is different. This is a very small place, and it’s
shameful that you should give parties and go about from house to house
playing cards.<a name="page_084" id="page_084"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>It seems so heartless not to wear mourning.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rather flippantly, to prevent the conversation from growing too
awkward.</i>] Why? I certainly should hate anyone to wear mourning for me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>You give all and sundry the impression that you’re perfectly callous.
What influence do you think such a thing may have on these young fellows
in the village who have to risk their lives with all the other brave
lads at the front? You take from them the comfort that we at home love
them and if they fall will hold their memories gratefully in our hearts
for ever.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Littlewood.</span></p>

<p>I shouldn’t have thought the eccentricity of one old woman could matter
very much to anyone.</p>

<p>When they sent for me and I went over to France I wasn’t very anxious,
because I knew that God, who had taken my eldest son, would leave my
second. You see, he was the only one I had left. And when I got there
and found he was dead&mdash;I suddenly felt that it didn’t matter.<a name="page_085" id="page_085"></a></p>

<p>Don’t, mother. Let her go on.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Littlewood.</span></p>

<p>I didn’t feel that anything very much mattered. It’s difficult to
explain exactly what I mean. I feel that I have nothing more to do with
the world and the world has nothing more to do with me. So far as I’m
concerned it’s a failure. You know I wasn’t very happy in my married
life, but I loved my two sons, and they made everything worth while, and
now they’re gone. Let others take up the&mdash;the adventure. I step aside.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>You’ve suffered too much, my dear.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Littlewood.</span></p>

<p>No, the strange thing is that I haven’t suffered very much. Don’t you
know how sometimes one has a horrid dream and knows one’s only dreaming
all the time? [<i>To the</i> <span class="smcap">Vicar</span>, <i>with the same good temper, almost
amused</i>.] You’re surprised that I should go to the theatre. Why? To me,
it’s no more unreal a spectacle than life. Life does seem<a name="page_086" id="page_086"></a> to me just
like a play now. I can’t take it very seriously. I feel strangely
detached. I have no ill-feeling for my fellow-creatures, but you don’t
seem very real to me or very important. Why shouldn’t I play bridge with
you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>Oh, but, my dear, my dear, there’s one reality that you can never escape
from. There’s God.</p>

<p>[<i>Jovially.</i>] It’s many a long day since you’ve been inside a church,
Doctor.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dr. Macfarlane.</span></p>

<p>Since you clerical gentlemen left off threatening me with eternal flames
I feel justified in following my own inclinations in the matter.</p>

<p>[<i>Chaffing him.</i>] But we still believe in annihilation.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dr. Macfarlane.</span></p>

<p>I’m willing to take my chance of that. It has no terrors for a man who’s

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dr. Macfarlane.</span></p>

<p>Shall I tell you? Because after repeated experiment I’ve reached the
conclusion that I’m not a whit the better for it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>You’ll have to give him up, Vicar. He’s a stubborn old thing. He takes

won’t kill you so long as he can make seven and sixpence a visit by

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colonel Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Do you mean to say that our Church doesn’t believe any longer in eternal
punishment?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Oh, father, hell has always left me perfectly cold. You and I are quite
safe. You see, mother would never be happy in heaven without us, and God
couldn’t refuse her anything she asked.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Affectionately.</i>] John, what nonsense you talk.<a name="page_090" id="page_090"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>I sometimes think the modern Church has been very rash in surrendering a
belief which has the authority of Our Lord himself. How many sinners
have been brought to repentance by the fear of everlasting punishment!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>That rather suggests calling down fire from heaven to light a cigar.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>That may be funny, but I don’t see the point of it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Good-humouredly.</i>] Well, I should have thought it hardly required
anything so tremendous as eternity to deal with human wickedness. I
suppose sin is due to a man’s character, which he can’t help, or to his
ignorance, for which he isn’t to blame.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>In fact, to your mind sin is all moonshine.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I think it a pity that Christianity has laid so much stress on it. We
assert in church that we’re miserable sinners, but I don’t think we mean
it, and what’s more I don’t think we are.<a name="page_091" id="page_091"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>We are conceived in sin, and sin is part of our inheritance. Why did
Christ die if not to atone for the sin of men?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>In war one gets to know very intimately all sorts of queer people. I
don’t suppose I shall ever know any men so well as I knew the men in my
company. They were honest and brave and cheerful, unselfish, good
fellows; perhaps they swore a good deal, and they got drunk if they had
the chance, and they had the glad eye for a pretty girl. But do you
think they were sinners for that? I don’t.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>Look in your own heart and say if you are not conscious of grievous,
terrible sin.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Frankly, I’m not.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>Do you mean to say that you have nothing to reproach yourself with?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I’ve done a certain number of things which I think were rather foolish,
but I can’t think of anything that I’m particularly ashamed of.<a name="page_092" id="page_092"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>Do you mean to tell me that you’ve always been perfectly chaste?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I’m normal and healthy. I’ve been no more chaste than any other man of
my age.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>And isn’t that sin?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I don’t think so. I think it’s human nature.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>We’re arguing at cross-purposes. If when you say “white” you mean what
the rest of the world calls “black,” all words are futile.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a smile.</i>] The singular thing is that if I’d answered your
question with a “yes,” you would probably have thought me a liar or a
fool.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>This terrible condition of humanity, which seems to cry out against the
very idea either of man’s dignity, or of God’s justice, has but one
explanation, and that is sin.<a name="page_093" id="page_093"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>You’re referring to the war? It needs some explaining, doesn’t it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>Every Christian must have asked himself why God allows the infamous
horror of war. I’m told the padres are constantly being asked by the
brave lads at the Front why the Almighty allows it to continue. I can’t
blame anyone for being puzzled. I’ve wrestled with the question long and
anxiously.... I can’t believe that God would leave His children to
suffer without a clue to His intention.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>The ways of God are inscrutable. How can we tell what are the aims of
the eternal? We only know that they are good.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile men are being killed like flies, their wives and mothers are
left desolate, and their children fatherless.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>You mustn’t forget exactly what is meant by “Almighty.” It means not so
much able to do all things as powerful over all things.<a name="page_094" id="page_094"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Ah, the padre of my regiment told me that. I may be very stupid, but I
think the distinction rather fine. For the plain man the difficulty
remains. Either God can’t stop the war even if He wants to, or He can
stop it and won’t.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>In my opinion there can be no hesitation. It is written: “Not a sparrow
shall fall on the ground without your Father.”</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>Remember that we have free will and God makes use of our free will to
punish us and to teach us and to make us more worthy of His grace and
mercy. Man, born in sin, justly brought this long-drawn disaster on
himself as surely as Adam brought on himself the divine punishment which
we all inherit.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>If I saw two small boys fighting I’d separate them, even though one was
a lazy little beggar and the other had stolen Farmer Giles’ apples. I
wouldn’t sit by and let them seriously hurt one another so that they
should be better boys in future.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>But you speak as though all this suffering must be useless. We all know
how suffering can purify and elevate. I’ve seen it myself over and over
again.<a name="page_095" id="page_095"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dr. Macfarlane.</span></p>

<p>People say that. They’re generally thinking of elderly ladies in
comfortable circumstances who with the aid of a very good doctor show a
becoming resignation in a chronic disease.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I should like some of those people who talk about the purifying
influence of suffering to have a mouthful of gas and see how they liked
it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>The war is terrible. Its cruelty is terrible. The suffering it has
caused is terrible. There is only one explanation for it; and that is
the loving kindness and the infinite mercy of our heavenly Father.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Can you bring yourself to believe that?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>We were given over to drunkenness and lust, to selfishness and flippancy
and pride. It needed this tremendous trial to purify us. It will be a
nobler England that comes out of the furnace. Oh, I pray to God that all
this blood may wash our souls clean so that we may once more be found
worthy in His sight.<a name="page_096" id="page_096"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>Amen.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>You must evidently know much more about it than I do. When the men in my
company did things I thought were wrong I used to jolly them a bit. I
fancy I got better results than if I’d bashed them on the head with a
sledge-hammer.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>Sin began with the beginning of the human story and has continued
through all its course. The motive of the divine redemption lies in the
fact that men, though created for so lofty a purpose, have plunged so
deep into sin and have so deeply defaced in themselves the image of God,
that only the self-sacrificing act of God in redeeming them can raise
them from ruin.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I wish you’d been a company-commander and had seen how gaily a man can
give his life for his friend.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>But I know, my dear boy, I know. And do you think God will be unmindful
of their sacrifice? I pray and believe that they will find mercy in His
sight. I am sure He is more ready to pardon than to punish. After all,
our Lord came to call sinners<a name="page_097" id="page_097"></a> to repentance, and who should know better
than the Ministers of God that to err is human, to forgive, divine?</p>

<p>[<i>Quietly and deliberately at first, but with ever-increasing

might, and with all my heart, and with all my soul. I’ve tried always to
lead my life in accordance with His will. I never forgot that I was as
nothing in His sight. I’ve been weak and sinful, but I’ve tried to do my
duty.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Yes, dear, you’ve been an example to us all.<a name="page_098" id="page_098"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Littlewood.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Taking no notice.</i>] Honestly, I’ve done everything I could that I
thought was pleasing in His sight. I’ve praised Him and magnified His
name. You’ve heard that my husband deserted me when I’d borne him two
children, and I was left alone. I brought them up to be honest, upright
and God-fearing men. When God took my eldest son I wept, but I turned to
the Lord and said: “Thy will be done.” He was a soldier, and he took his
chance, and he died in a good cause.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>A great and a good cause.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Littlewood.</span></p>

<p>But why did God take my second? He was the only one I had left, the only
comfort of my old age, my only joy, the only thing I had to prevent me
from seeing that my life had been wasted and it would have been better
if I had never been born. I haven’t deserved that. When a horse has
served me long and faithfully till he’s too old to work I have the right
to send him to the knacker’s yard, but I don’t, I put him out to grass.
I wouldn’t treat a dog as my Father has treated me. I’ve been cheated.
You say that God will forgive us our sins, but who is going to forgive
God? Not I. Never. Never!</p>

others. Why is evil permitted in the world by an all-good God?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>I should have thought it was a revival of rhetoric rather than of
religion. I’m not enormously impressed by the cultured journalist who
uses God to balance a sentence or adorn a phrase.<a name="page_104" id="page_104"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>But it hasn’t only been among educated men. Not the least remarkable
thing about the war has been the return of our brave lads at the Front
to the faith which so many of us thought they had forgotten. What is
your explanation of that?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Fear with the most part. Perplexity with the rest.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>Don’t you think it very rash to reject a belief that all the ablest men
in the world have held since the dawn of history?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>When you’re dealing with a belief, neither the number nor the ability of
those who hold it makes it a certainty. Only proof can do that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>Are you quite sure that at the bottom of your heart it’s not conceit
that makes you think differently from the rest of us?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>No, my dear, let us not ascribe unworthy motives to our antagonist.<a name="page_105" id="page_105"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] At all events, not yet.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>What makes you think that the existence of God can’t be proved?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I suppose at this time of day people wouldn’t still be proving it if
proof were possible.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>My dear fellow, the fact that there is no people on the face of the
earth, however barbarous and degraded, without some belief in God, is
the most conclusive proof you can want.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>What of? It’s conclusive proof that the desire for His existence is
universal. It’s not proof that the desire is fulfilled.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>I see you have the usual Rationalistic arguments at your fingers’ ends.
Believe me, they’re old friends, and if I’ve answered them once I’ve
answered them a thousand times.<a name="page_106" id="page_106"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>And have you ever convinced anyone who wasn’t convinced before?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>I can’t make the blind to see, you know.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I wonder that hasn’t suggested to you a very obvious conclusion.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>What?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Why, that arguments are futile. Think for a minute. You don’t believe in
God for any of the reasons that are given for His existence. You believe
in Him because with all your heart you <i>feel</i> that He exists. No
argument can ever touch that feeling. The heart is independent of logic
and its rules.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>I daresay there’s something in what you say.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Well, it’s the same with me. If you ask me why I don’t believe in the
existence of God I suppose I can give you a certain number of reasons,
but the real one, the one that gives all the others their force, is that
I feel it in my heart.<a name="page_107" id="page_107"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>What is the cause of your feeling?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I’m sure you’ll think it very insufficient. I had a friend and he was
killed.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>I’m afraid one must be prepared to lose one’s friends in a war like
this.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I daresay it’s very silly and sentimental of me. One gets used to one’s
pals dying. Someone says to you: “So-and-So’s knocked out.” And you
answer: “Is he really? Poor chap.” And you don’t think very much more
about it. Robbie Harrison wasn’t quite an ordinary man.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I was afraid you’d feel his death very much. You never mentioned it in
your letters. I felt it was because you couldn’t bear to speak of it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>He was one of those lucky beggars who do everything a little better than
anybody else. He was clever and awfully nice-looking and amusing. I
never knew anyone who loved life so much as he did.<a name="page_108" id="page_108"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I remember his saying to me once: “Isn’t it ripping to be alive?”</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>But there was something more in him than that. He had one quality which
was rather out of the ordinary. It’s difficult to explain what it was
like. It seemed to shine about him like a mellow light. It was like the
jolly feeling of the country in May. And do you know what it was?
Goodness. Just goodness. He was the sort of man that I should like to
be.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>He was a dear.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I was awfully excited when war was declared. I was in India at the time.
I moved heaven and earth to get out to the Front. I thought war the
noblest sport in the world. I found it a dreary, muddy, dirty, stinking,
bloody business. And I suppose Robbie’s death was the last straw. It
seemed so unjust. I don’t know that it was grief so much that I felt as
indignation. I was revolted by all the horror and pain and suffering.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>You must have seen some dreadful things.<a name="page_109" id="page_109"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps it’s Christianity that has shown us the possibility of a higher
morality than Christianity teaches. I daresay I’m quite wrong. I can
only tell you that all that’s moral in my soul revolts at the thought of
a God who can permit the monstrous iniquity of war. I can’t believe that
there is a God in heaven.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>But do you realise that if there isn’t, the world is meaningless?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>That may be. But if there is it’s infamous.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>What have you got to put in the place of religion? What answer can you
give to the riddle of the universe?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I may think your answer wrong and yet have no better one to put in its
place.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>Have you nothing to tell us at all when we ask you why man is here and
what is his destiny? You are like a rudderless ship in a stormy sea.<a name="page_110" id="page_110"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I suppose the human race has arisen under the influence of conditions
which are part of the earth’s history, and under the influence of other
conditions it will come to an end. I don’t see that there is any more
meaning in life than in the statement that two and two are four.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With suppressed passion.</i>] Then you think that all our efforts and
struggles, our pain and sorrow, our aims, are senseless?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Do you remember our going to the Russian ballet before the war? I’ve
never forgotten a certain gesture of one of the dancers. It was an
attitude she held for an instant, in the air; it was the most lovely
thing I ever saw in my life; you felt it could only have been achieved
by infinite labour, and the fact that it was so fleeting, like the
shadow of a bird flying over a river, made it all the more wonderful.
I’ve often thought of it since, and it has seemed to me a very good
symbol of life.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>John, you can’t be serious.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I’ll tell you what I mean. Life seems to me like a huge jig-saw puzzle
that doesn’t make any picture, but if we like we can make little
patterns, as it were, out of the pieces.<a name="page_111" id="page_111"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>What is the use of that?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>There’s no use, and no need. It’s merely something we can do for our own
satisfaction. Pain and sorrow are some of the pieces that we have to
deal with. By making the most of all our faculties, by using all our
opportunities, out of the manifold events of life, our deeds, our
feelings, our thoughts, we can make a design which is intricate,
dignified, and beautiful. And death at one stroke completes and destroys
it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>There is a moment’s silence.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Poole.</span></p>

<p>I wonder why you’re coming to church to-morrow to be married?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>It’s lucky for you the Vicar is broad-minded. A stricter man might think
it his duty to refuse the blessing of the Church to an unbeliever.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Anxiously.</i>] Vicar, you’re not thinking of doing anything like that?<a name="page_112" id="page_112"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Vicar.</span></p>

<p>I confess the question has crossed my mind. [<i>Kindly.</i>] I don’t think I
can bring myself to expose such good Christians as you and Sylvia to
such a humiliation.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>You need not harass yourself, Vicar. I’ve decided not to marry John.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Aghast.</i>] Sylvia! Sylvia, you can’t mean that!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>I was dreadfully troubled the other day when you told us you’d lost your
faith, but I hadn’t the courage to say anything then. It came as such an
awful shock.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>But you never made the least sign.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>I hadn’t time to think it out, but I’ve been thinking hard ever since,
day and night, and I’ve listened very carefully to what you’ve said
to-day. I can’t keep up the pretence any more. I’ve quite made up my
mind. I won’t marry you.<a name="page_113" id="page_113"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>But in God’s name, why?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>You are not the John I loved and promised myself to. It’s a different
man that has come back from abroad. I have nothing in common with that
man.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Sylvia, you don’t mean to say that you don’t care for me any more
because on certain matters I don’t hold the same views as you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>But those matters are the most important in the world. You talk as
though it were a difference of opinion over the colour of our
drawing-room curtains. You don’t even understand me any more.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>How can I understand something that seems absolutely unreasonable to me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Do you think religion is something I take up with my Prayer-book when I
go to church, and put away on a shelf when I get home again? John, God
is a living presence that is always with me. I never at any moment lose
the consciousness of that divine love which with infinite mercy tends
and protects me.<a name="page_114" id="page_114"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>But, dear heart, you know me well enough. You know I would never hinder
you in the exercise of your religion. I would always treat it with the
utmost respect.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>How could we possibly be happy when all that to me is the reason and the
beauty of life, to you is nothing but a lie?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>With tolerance on both sides, and, I hope, respect, there’s no reason
why two people shouldn’t live peaceably together no matter how different
their views are.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>How can I be tolerant when I see you deep in error? Oh, it’s more than
error, it’s sin. You’ve had your choice between light and darkness, and
you’ve deliberately chosen darkness. You are a deserter. If words mean
anything at all you are condemned.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>But, my dear, a man believes what he can. You don’t seriously think that
a merciful God is going to punish him because he’s unable to believe
something that he finds incredible?<a name="page_115" id="page_115"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>No one doubts that Our Lord will have mercy on those who have never had
the chance of receiving His teaching. You’ve had the chance, and you’ve
refused to take it. Do you forget the Parable of the Ten Talents? It is
a terrible warning.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>After all, if I’m wrong I hurt nobody but myself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>You forget what marriage is. It makes us one flesh. I am bidden to
cleave to you and to follow you. How can I, when our souls must ever be
separated by an unsurpassable abyss?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Sylvia, this is a dreadfully grave decision you’re making. Be careful
that you’re acting rightly.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Sylvia, you can’t throw me over like this after we’ve been engaged for
seven years. It’s too heartless.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>I don’t trust you. I have no hold over you. What have you to aim at
beside the satisfaction of your own vulgar appetite? Sin means nothing
to you.<a name="page_116" id="page_116"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>My dear, you don’t suppose it’s religion that makes a man decent? If
he’s kind and honest and truthful it’s because it’s his nature, not
because he believes in God or fears hell.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>We’re neither of us very young any more, there’s no reason why we should
make a mystery of natural things. If we married my greatest hope was
that we should have children.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>It was mine too.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Have you asked yourself how this would affect them? Which are they to
be, Christians or Agnostics?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>My dear, I promise you I will not interfere with your teaching of them.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Do you mean to say you will stand by while they are taught a pack of
worthless lies?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Your faith has been the faith of our people for hundreds of years. In
the case of a difference of<a name="page_117" id="page_117"></a> opinion I could not take it on myself to
refuse children instruction in it. When they reach years of discretion
they can judge for themselves.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>And supposing they ask you about things? The story of Our Saviour
appeals to children, you know. It’s very natural that they should put
you questions. What will you answer?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I don’t think you could ask me to say what I thought untrue.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>He could always refer them to you, Sylvia dear.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

set your children in a matter of which I was impressing on them the
enormous importance?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a smile.</i>] My dear, surely you’re letting a lack of humour cloud

<p>He died quite peacefully about an hour ago. I’ve just been to gather
some flowers to put in his room.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Mrs. Wharton, I’m so sorry. I’m so dreadfully sorry for you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Where is John?<a name="page_127" id="page_127"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I think he must have gone out for a walk. I went to his room a little
while ago and he wasn’t there. He wanted to sit up with me last night,
but I wouldn’t let him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>But ... but doesn’t John know his father is dead?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>No, not yet.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Didn’t you call him?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I had no idea the end was so near. George wanted to be alone with me,
Sylvia. We’d been married for thirty-five years, you see. He was
conscious almost to the last. He died quite suddenly, like a child going
to sleep.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>It’s such a terrible loss. You poor dear, you must be quite
heart-broken.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>It’s a very great loss, but I’m not heart-broken. George is happy and at
rest. We should be very poor Christians if the death of those we love
made us unhappy. George has entered into eternal life.<a name="page_128" id="page_128"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Mrs. Wharton, what a blessed thing it is to have a faith like yours.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>My dear, a very wonderful thing happened last night. I can’t feel grief
for dear George’s death because of the recollection of that. I feel so
strange. I feel as though I were walking in an enchanted garden.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know what you mean.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Since that day when George refused to talk with the Vicar I never dared
mention the subject. He was not himself. It made me so unhappy. And then
last night, soon after Dr. Macfarlane went away, he asked of his own
accord for Mr. Poole. The Vicar’s a dear, kind man. He’d said to me that
if ever George asked for him he’d come at once, at any hour of the day
or night. So I sent for him. He gave George the Holy Sacrament. And
Sylvia, a miracle happened.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>A miracle?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>No sooner had the bread and the wine touched his lips than he was
transfigured. All his&mdash;his anxiety<a name="page_129" id="page_129"></a> left him, and he was once more his
dear, good, brave self. He was quite happy to die. It was as though an
unseen hand had pulled back a dark curtain of clouds and he saw before
him, not night and a black coldness, but a path of golden sunshine that
led straight to the arms of God.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>I’m so glad. I’m happy too now.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>The Vicar read the prayers for the dying and then he left us. We talked
of the past and of our reunion in a little while. And then he died.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>It’s wonderful. Yes, it was a miracle.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>All through my life I’ve been conscious of the hand of God shaping the
destinies of man. I’ve never seen His loving mercy more plainly
manifest.</p>

<p>Oh, Mrs. Wharton, wouldn’t you prefer to tell him yourself?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>You know he loves you, Sylvia. It would make me so happy if you two
could arrive at some understanding. It seems such a pity that the
happiness of both of you should be ruined.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>I would do anything in the world for John, but I can’t sacrifice what is
and must be dearer to me even than he.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Can’t you teach him to believe?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I wish I could. I pray for him night and day.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I wished afterwards that I’d asked him to be present when his father and
I received the Communion. I think at that last solemn moment he might
have been moved to receive it with us.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

hesitate to tell a lie to save another’s life.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps not. [<i>With a faint smile.</i>] We must thank God that we’re not
likely to be put in such a position. Why did you ask me that?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>I was wondering what one should do if one could only rescue somebody
from terrible danger by committing a great sin. Do you think one ought
to do it or not?<a name="page_133" id="page_133"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>My dear, you haven’t the right to offend God for the sake of anyone in
the world.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Not even for the sake of anyone you loved?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Surely not, my dear. And no one who loved you would wish you for a
moment to do a wicked thing for his sake.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

you risk your soul?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Good morning! You’re very early.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>I looked in to ask how your father was.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>When I left him last night he was fairly comfortable. I’ll go and find
out from mother how he is.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>No, don’t&mdash;don’t disturb him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I’m going to take mother’s place in a few minutes. I awoke early, so I
went for a walk.... You’ve been very good and kind to all of us during
these wretched days, Sylvia. I don’t know what we should have done
without you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>I’ve been so dreadfully sorry. And you all had so much to bear. It
wasn’t only the thought that the poor dear couldn’t&mdash;can’t recover, but
... it was so much worse than that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a quick glance at her.</i>] I suppose it was inevitable that you
should see it too. Somehow I hoped that only I and mother knew.<a name="page_136" id="page_136"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Oh, John, you can’t mind about me. I’ve loved your father as though he
were my own. Nothing he did could make me love him less.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>He’s afraid to die. It’s dreadful to see his terror and to be able to do
nothing to help him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Would you do anything to help him if you could?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Of course.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>It’s unfortunate that you found it necessary to say what you did about
religion. He’s always been a very simple man. He always accepted without
question the faith in which he was brought up. Perhaps he’s not quite so
sure now.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Nonsense, Sylvia. Father’s faith is very much too steady for it to be
unsettled by any opinions of mine.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Ordinarily, I dare say. But he’s ill, he’s in terrible pain, he’s not
himself. I think perhaps it’s a pity you didn’t hold your tongue. It’s
so easy to create doubts and so hard to allay them.<a name="page_137" id="page_137"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Much disturbed.</i>] That’s an awful thought to have put into my head,
Sylvia. I should never forgive myself if....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>If you’d believed as we believe, he would have been supported, as it
were, by all our faith. It would have made that terrible passage from
this life to the life to come a little less terrible. You’ve failed him
just when he needed you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Indignantly.</i>] Oh, Sylvia, how can you say anything so heartless?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Coldly.</i>] It’s true.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Heaven knows, I know that death isn’t easy. You can’t think I’d be so
inhuman as to do anything to make it more difficult?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Except mortify your pride.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Impatiently.</i>] What has pride got to do with it?<a name="page_138" id="page_138"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>There was pride in every word you said. Are you sure it’s not pride of
intellect that’s responsible for your change of heart?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Icily.</i>] Perhaps. How do you suggest I should mortify it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Well, you see, you can confess your error.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I don’t think it’s an error.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>At least you can undo some of the harm you’ve done. Do you know what is
chiefly tormenting your father? Your refusal to receive the Holy
Communion. He keeps talking about it to your mother. He keeps harping on
it. He’s dreadfully distressed about it. If you received the Communion,
John, it would give your father peace.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Sylvia, how can I?<a name="page_139" id="page_139"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>All your life your father has done everything in the world for you.
Nothing’s been too good for you. You owe him all your happiness,
everything you are and hope to be. Can’t you do this one little thing
for him?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>No, it’s out of the question. I really can’t. I’m awfully sorry.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>How can you be so hard? It’s the last wish he’ll ever have in the world.
It’s your last chance of showing your love for him. Oh, John, show a
little mercy to his weakness!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>But, Sylvia, it would be blasphemous.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>What are you talking about? You don’t believe. To you it’s merely an
idle ceremony. What can it matter to you if you go through a meaningless
form?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I’ve been a Christian too long. I have a hundred generations of
Christianity behind me.<a name="page_140" id="page_140"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>You never hesitated at coming to church when we were going to be
married.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>That was different.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>How? That was a sacrament, too. Are you afraid of a little bread and
wine that a priest has said a few words over?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Sylvia, don’t torment me. I tell you I can’t.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Scornfully.</i>] I never imagined you would be superstitious. You’re
frightened. You feel just like people about sitting thirteen at table.
Of course it’s all nonsense, but there may be something in it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know what I feel. I only know that I, an unbeliever, can’t take
part in a ceremony that was sacred to me when I believed.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Bitterly.</i>] It’s very natural. It only means that you love yourself
better than anyone else. Why should one expect you to have pity for your
father, or gratitude?<a name="page_141" id="page_141"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Sylvia, where did you learn to say such cruel things? I can’t, I
tell you, I can’t. If father were in his normal mind, neither he nor
mother would wish me to do such a thing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>But your mother does wish it. Oh, John, don’t be stubborn. For God’s
sake give yourself the opportunity. Your father’s dying, John; you have
no time to lose.... John, the Communion Service has only just begun. If
you get on your bicycle you’ll be there in time. The other day the Vicar
said if you presented yourself at the Communion table he would not
hesitate to administer it.</p>

<p>Everybody’s so very kind in this world. It makes one feel humble....
George and I have been married for five and thirty years. He never said
a cross word to me. He was always gentle and considerate. I daresay I
was very troublesome now and then, but he was never impatient with me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Littlewood.</span></p>

<p>Is it true that John and Sylvia are not going to be married after all?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I’m afraid so.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Littlewood.</span></p>

<p>Isn’t it strange how people in this world seem to go out of their way to
make themselves unhappy!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I’ve talked it over with Sylvia. Religion means so much to her. She
wouldn’t have minded if John had come back blind and crippled, she’d
have devoted her life to him without a murmur.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Doctor, don’t say sarcastic things. You don’t know how deeply Sylvia
is suffering. But it’s a matter of conscience. And I do see that one
can’t ask anyone to compromise with his soul.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dr. Macfarlane.</span></p>

<p>I have an idea our souls are like our manners, all the better when we

<p>I’m glad to have you two old friends with me now. The only thing that

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dr. Macfarlane.</span></p>

<p>You came here immediately after your honeymoon. Is that really
thirty-five years ago?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Littlewood.</span></p>

<p>My mother and I were the first people who called on you. I remember how
stylish we thought you in your green velvet, Evelyn.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I remember it well. I had it dyed black its third year. I think the
fashions were very much more ladylike in those days. A bustle did set
off a woman’s figure, there’s no denying that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dr. Macfarlane.</span></p>

<p>What waists you had and how tight you used to lace!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>I often wonder if the young people ever enjoy themselves as much as we
used to. Do you remember the picnics we used to have?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Littlewood.</span></p>

<p>And now it’s all as if it had never been, all our love and pain and joy
and sorrow. We’re just two funny old women, and it really wouldn’t have
mattered a row of pins if we’d never been born.<a name="page_148" id="page_148"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dr. Macfarlane.</span></p>

<p>I wonder, I wonder.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>You’ve had the privilege of giving two sons to a noble cause. Wasn’t it
worth while to be born for that?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Littlewood.</span></p>

<p>Sometimes I’ve asked myself if this world in which we’re living now
isn’t hell. Perhaps all the unhappiness my husband caused me and the
death of those two boys of mine is a punishment for sins that I
committed in some other life in some other part of the universe.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>Charlotte, sometimes you say things that frighten me. I’m haunted by the
fear that you may destroy yourself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Littlewood.</span></p>

<p>I? No, why should I? I don’t feel that life is important enough for me
to give it a deliberate end. I don’t trouble to kill the fly that walks
over my ceiling.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dr. Macfarlane.</span></p>

<p>I’ve been curing or killing people for hard on fifty years, and it seems
to me that I’ve seen innumerable generations enter upon the shifting
scene, act their little part, and pass away. Alas, who<a name="page_149" id="page_149"></a> can deny that in
this world virtue is very often unrewarded and vice unpunished?
Happiness too rarely comes to the good, and the prizes of this life go
too frequently to the undeserving. The rain falls on the just and on the
unjust alike, but the unjust generally have a stout umbrella. It looks
as though there were little justice in the world, and chance seems to
rule man and all his circumstances.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wharton.</span></p>

<p>But we know that all that is mere idle seeming.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dr. Macfarlane.</span></p>

<p>Seeming perhaps, but why idle? Seeming is all we know. The other day
when you were talking I held my tongue, because I thought you’d say I
was a silly old fool if I put my word in, but I’ve puzzled over
suffering and pain too. You see, in my trade we see so much of them. It
made me unhappy, and for long I doubted the goodness of God, as you
doubt it, dear friend.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Littlewood.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a smile.</i>] I think you’re preaching at me, Doctor.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dr. Macfarlane.</span></p>

<p>Then it’s the first time in my life.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Littlewood.</span></p>

<p>Go on.<a name="page_150" id="page_150"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dr. Macfarlane.</span></p>

<p>I want to tell you how <i>I</i> found peace. My explanation is as old as the
hills, and I believe many perfectly virtuous persons have been frizzled
alive for accepting it. Our good Vicar would say I was a heretic. I
can’t help it. I can’t see any other way of reconciling the goodness of
God with the existence of evil.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Littlewood.</span></p>

<p>Well, what is it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dr. Macfarlane.</span></p>

<p>I don’t believe that God is all-powerful and all-knowing. But I think He
struggles against evil as we do. I don’t believe He means to chasten us
by suffering or to purify us by pain. I believe pain and suffering are
evil, and that He hates them, and would crush them if He could. And I
believe that in this age-long struggle between God and evil we can help,
all of us, even the meanest; for in some way, I don’t know how, I
believe that all our goodness adds to the strength of God, and
perhaps&mdash;who can tell?&mdash;will give Him such power that at last He will be
able utterly to destroy evil&mdash;utterly, with its pain and suffering.

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Be quiet! You’ve insisted on talking about it, and now, by God, you’re
going to listen to me. Do you know what I felt? Shame. When I took the
bread and the wine, I thought they’d choke me. Because once I believed
so devoutly it seemed to me that I was doing an awful thing.

lie. And I feel dirty to the depths of my soul.</p>

<p>[<i>Passionately.</i>] John, if you only knew! I only thought of you. I only
thought of you all the time.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Don’t be such a hypocrite.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Brokenly.</i>] I expected a miracle.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>At this time of day?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>For God’s sake have mercy on me! It was your mother who put the idea in
my head. Your father received the Communion last night.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>You have no charity for human weakness. You were all so terrified that
he shouldn’t make an edifying end. As if it mattered if the poor dear’s
nerve failed him at the last.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Eagerly.</i>] But it didn’t. That’s just it. You noticed your mother’s
face yourself. Notwithstanding all her grief she’s happy. Do you know
why?<a name="page_160" id="page_160"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>As though suddenly inspired.</i>] Because when he’d received the Blessed
Sacrament the fear of death left him. He was once more a brave and
gallant gentleman. He had no dread any longer of the perilous journey
before him. He was happy to die.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>More gently.</i>] Is that true? Dear father, I’m very glad.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>It was a miracle. It was a miracle.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I still don’t follow.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>I thought that when you knelt at the chancel steps, and received the
Communion as you used to receive it when you were a boy, all the
feelings of your boyhood would rush back on you. I had to make you take
it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>In my frame of mind? Surely I had no right to.<a name="page_161" id="page_161"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>I know. That’s what makes my sin the greater. Perhaps I was mad. To God
all things are possible. I felt certain you’d believe.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Very gravely.</i>] Perhaps you have worked a miracle, but not the one you
expected.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>What do you mean?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>When you said you wouldn’t marry me I was&mdash;I was knocked endways&mdash;I felt
like a man who’s been shipwrecked. All my plans for the future had been
bound up with you. I couldn’t imagine it without you. I felt utterly
forlorn.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>But don’t you know what it cost me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>At first I couldn’t think you meant it. When you said you didn’t love
me, I couldn’t believe it. It seemed too preposterous. I was awfully
miserable, Sylvia.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>John, I didn’t want you to be unhappy.<a name="page_162" id="page_162"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>And then, when I received the Communion something quite strange took
place in me. I can’t tell you what I felt. I felt as though mother had
heard me saying something obscene. I forced myself to go through with
it, because I really did think it might give poor father some peace of
mind. But it was you who made me do it. The thought of you filled me
with horror.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With dismay.</i>] John!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>You’ve cured me, Sylvia. I ought to be grateful to you for that. My love
for you has fallen from me as a cloak might fall from one’s shoulders. I
see the truth now. You were quite right. In these long years we’ve
become different people and we have nothing to say to one another any
more.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Passionately.</i>] But I love you, John! How can you be so blind? Don’t
you see that I only did it because I loved you? Oh, John, you can’t
leave me now! I’ve waited for you all these years. I’ve longed for you
to come back. Forgive me if I did wrong. I can’t lose you now. I love
you, John, you won’t leave me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>After a moment’s pause.</i>] Of course I won’t leave you. I thought you
didn’t want to marry me.<a name="page_163" id="page_163"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Hardly knowing what she is saying.</i>] I’m not young any more. I’ve lost
my freshness. I’ve got nobody but you now. Oh, John, don’t forsake me! I
couldn’t bear it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>[<i>As though he were talking to a child.</i>] My dear, don’t distress
yourself. I’m not thinking of forsaking you. We’ll be married as soon as
ever we can.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Yes, we’ll be married, won’t we? I love you so much, John, I’ll make you
love me. I couldn’t lose you now. I’ve waited too long.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Come, darling, you mustn’t be unhappy. It’s all settled now. Dry your
eyes. You don’t want to look a fright, do you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Clinging to him.</i>] I’m so miserable.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Nonsense, give me a nice kiss, and we’ll forget all about our troubles.
I’ll try to make you a good husband, Sylvia. I’ll do all I can to make
you happy. Give me a kiss.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>When he seeks to raise her face in order to kiss her, she tears
herself violently from him.</i></p></div>

<p><a name="page_164" id="page_164"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>No, don’t! Don’t touch me! God give me strength! I’m so pitifully weak.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Sylvia!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Don’t come near me! For God’s sake! [<i>She puts her hands before her
face, trying to control and to collect herself, and there is a moment’s
pause.</i>] It never occurred to me that you didn’t care for me any more,
and when you told me, for a moment I lost my head. Forgive me for that,
dear, and forget it. I’m not going to marry you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Now, Sylvia, don’t be idiotic. It would be so unseemly if I had to drag
you to the altar by the hair of your head.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>You’re very kind, John. I suppose it wouldn’t be very good form to back
out of it now. I’m poor, and I’ve wasted my best years waiting for you.
You needn’t worry about what is going to happen to me. I can earn my
living as well as other women.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Sylvia, you’re torturing yourself and me. Can’t you forget what I
said in a moment of exasperation? You must know how deep my affection is
for you.<a name="page_165" id="page_165"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>I don’t want to forget. It is the will of God. I lied. I did an
abominable and evil thing. I don’t think you can imagine how terrible my
sin has been. I risked my soul to save you, John, and God has inflicted
on me a punishment infinitely less than I deserved. He has taken out of
your heart the love you bore me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>But you love me, Sylvia.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Better than anyone in the world. I’ve loved you ever since I was a child
of ten. That’s only the weakness of my flesh. My soul exults in the
great mercy that God has shown me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Oh, my dear, you’re going to be so unhappy.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>No, don’t be sorry for me. You’ve given me a great opportunity.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>I’ve been mortified because I was able to do so little in the war. I
knew it was my duty to stay<a name="page_166" id="page_166"></a> here and look after mother. But I wanted to
go out to France and do my bit like all my friends.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>That was very natural.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Now at last I have the chance to do something. No sacrifice is worthless
in the eyes of God. A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not
despise. I sacrifice now all that was precious to me in the world, my
love and my hope of happiness in this life, and I sacrifice it with a
cheerful heart, and I pray that God may accept it. So shall I do my part
to atone for the sins which have brought on this horrible war.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>It would have been better if I’d never come back. I’ve caused misery and
suffering to all of you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>John, you took away the ring you gave me when we became engaged. You
threw it in the fire.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I’m afraid that was very silly of me. I did it in a moment of
bitterness.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>You went into Canterbury to buy a wedding ring. What have you done with
it?<a name="page_167" id="page_167"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>I have it here. Why?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>Can I have it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Of course.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>He takes it out of his waistcoat pocket, and, wondering, gives it
to her.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Sylvia.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Slipping the ring on her finger.</i>] I will put the love of man out of
my life. I will turn from what is poor and transitory to what is
everlasting. I will be the bride of One whose love is never denied to
them that seek it. The love of God is steadfast and enduring. I can put
all my trust in that and I shall never find it wanting.... Good-bye,
John, God bless you now and always.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">John.</span></p>

<p>Good-bye, dear child.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
